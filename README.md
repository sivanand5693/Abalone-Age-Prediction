# Abalone-Age-Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope - a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.

The age of abalone here is obtained from the number of rings on the shell. So the response variable of interest here is number of rings treated as a continuous value.

Data comes from the study:
